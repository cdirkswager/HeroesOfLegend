# [HeroesOfLegend](https://baldursgate3.game/mods#/m/heroes-of-legend)
This mod intended to express individuality through your feat choices.

You are no longer able to choose +2 ASI and required to choose a feat every ASI. 
Each base feat has been given an additional +1 ASI, so existing half-feats will provide a net +2 ASI.

No mechanical changes are made.
Excluded Feats(promote variance): Alert, Great Weapon Master, Lucky, Resilient, Sharpshooter, and Tavern Brawler. 

If you have any problems please leave a comment, this is my first mod!


Currently this mod updates each feat individually. Depending on the desire - I may provide support for other feat mods. 
This mod WILL conflict with other mods that overwrite existing feats, risk is low. I doubt it would cause any harm to your save. Keep me informed.
